\section{Summary}

The data analysis showed marked improvements in Kubernetes networking performance over the last couple of years. We saw performance improvements across the board for all four CNIs included with the Rancher Kubernetes Engine.

The power is in the data—we were able to identify Flannel and Cilium as the two CNIs that will deliver the best performance and recommend them for future cluster configurations.

Cilium is the most promising new development in Kubernetes networking, and the venerable Flannel is holding up well and delivering similar performance with a smaller footprint and a smaller feature set.

We were merely able to scratch the surface with this secondary analysis, but I do hope that you will find at least some valuable insights and pointers to start with. A big shoutout to Alexis Duscatel of infraBuilder; none of this would have been possible without their excellent work!

To quote Toshinori Yagi: “Next, it’s your turn.”\footnote{\textit{Crunchyroll (2024)}: 40 My Hero Academia Quotes Worth Remembering. \cite{mhaQuotes}} - go and create your own cluster!

Happy Ranching!
