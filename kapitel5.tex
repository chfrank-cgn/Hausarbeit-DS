\section{Summary}

\onehalfspacing

From the analysis, we were able to show marked improvements in Kubernetes networking. We saw performance improvements across the board for the CNIs included in the Rancher Kubernetes Engine.

The power is in the data—we were able to identify the two CNIs that will deliver the best performance and recommend them for future cluster configurations.

Cilium is the most promising new development in Kubernetes networking, and the venerable Flannel is holding up well.

We were merely able to scratch the surface with this secondary analysis, but I do hope that you will find at least some valuable insights and pointers to start with; none of this would have been possible without the excellent work by Alexis Duscatel of infraBuilder!

To quote Toshinori Yagi: “Next, it’s your turn.”\footnote{\textit{Crunchyroll (2024)}: 40 My Hero Academia Quotes Worth Remembering. \cite{mhaQuotes}} - go and create your own cluster networks!

Happy Ranching!
